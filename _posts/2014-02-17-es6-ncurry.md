While reading through [Highland Streams](https://github.com/caolan/highland), I noticed how many
of the functional bits ES6 will help--as soon as we get them.  One function I rather liked, `ncurry`
follows the basic `curry` syntax but solves the _"function.length problem"_ by passing `n`, the
length, as the first parameter.

The important part internally works just like `leave` (see
[Take or Leave Functional Programming](http://autosponge.github.io/blog/2014/01/29/take-or-leave-functional-programming/)).
I rewrote the functions needed using ES6 notation; making heavy use of rest and spread operators.  This
included an ES6-style rewrite of `leave`.

I see one possible downside to this implementation.  We can't use `this` when applying `leave`'s function.
We have to use `null` unless we add a `receiver` parameter to the signature somewhere.

{% highlight js %}
var slice_ = _part_.create_( Array.prototype.slice );

var take_ = slice_.bind( null, 0 );

var leave = ( n )
    => ( fn, ...a )
    	=> ( ...b )
    		=> fn.apply( null, take_( n )( [...a, ...b] ) );

var ncurry = ( n, fn, ...a ) => {
    if ( a.length >= n ) {
        return leave( n )( fn )( ...a );
    }
    return ( ...b ) => {
        var ab = [...a, ...b];
      	return ab.length < n ? ncurry( n, fn, ...ab ) : leave( n )( fn )( ...ab );
    };
};

var max = ncurry( 3, Math.max );
max( 1, 2 )( 3, 4 ); //3
