If you like web development but hate design, raise your hand.

To be clear, I hate design because I suck at it.  I'm good at implementing
someone else's designs but I really don't find joy in designing something from scratch.

_Enter this __new era__ of [web components](http://webcomponents.org/)._  
Google's [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) web components captured my attention because that
team does a great job of communicating their vision and [making demos](http://www.polymer-project.org/resources/video.html).  
On top of that, the new 
[Paper elements collection](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html#paper-button)
seem like good design.  I mean, due to a lack of knowledge on the subject, I can't say it _is_ good design, 
but I have no qualms about ripping it off... over and over... and over.

To continue my learning, share the joys of building sweet-lookin' stuff with no design chops, and 
make good on some promises, I made a presentation _about_ web components _using_ web components (aka [dogfooding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)).

I welcome any comments, questions, or corrections as it will help me better deliver this presentation at 
[HartfordJS](http://hartfordjs.com/) at the [end of the month](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hartfordjs-july-2014-tickets-12339679313).
