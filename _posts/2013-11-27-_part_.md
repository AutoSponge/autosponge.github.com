[\_part\_](https://github.com/AutoSponge/_part_), a meta-utility, proposes a pattern
for creating utility functions from native methods using a more functional programming style.
However, rather than settle the "argument" of __function-first__ versus __receiver-first__,
\_part\_ offers a simple, yet intuitive, way to use both styles.

## Patterns

In object-oriented (O.O.) style programming, we see the "dot" between objects and
their methods: `<subject>.<verb>`.  The subject-verb (or receiver-method) pattern
works well when you know the receiver, it has said method, and it does not change.

But in other situations, you may prefer a functional, or _point-free_, style: `<verb>(<subject>)`.
Most commonly, developers in loosely-typed languages, like JavaScript, use this pattern while
_mapping_ over several objects.

## Arguments over arguments

While functional programmers agree on the power and utility of their programming style
over traditional OO, there exists a fundamental argument over how to pass parameters
to these functions.  In the OO world, we simply add arguments to the end of the
code sentence, `<subject>.<verb>(<predicate>)`.  In the functional world, which do
you prefer, receiver-first `<verb>(<subject>, <predicate>)` or predicate-first
`<verb>(<predicate>, <subject>)`?  Does your preference change?

In many situations, like the _mapping_ situation mentioned above, the _method_ takes
a function argument.  When that argument precedes the receiver, you used the
"function-first" approach.  Because other methods, like _reduce_, may have additional
parameters, many functional programmers use the object-first approach.  This way,
they do not need to decide where additional parameters go: before or after the
predicate function.

## Why not both?

In __\_part\___, you use typical OO functions (like the ones in native prototypes) to
create two functional counterparts, "left-part" and "right-part", which partially apply the receiver
or parameters respectively.

The OO map example:

{% highlight js %}
var arr = [1,2,3];

function addOne( n ) {
  return n + 1;
}

arr.map( addOne ); // [2,3,4]
{% endhighlight %}

The "left-part" version:

{% highlight js %}
_map( arr )( addOne ); //[2,3,4]
{% endhighlight %}

The "right-part" version:

{% highlight js %}
map_( addOne )( arr ); //[2,3,4]
{% endhighlight %}

Include additional arguments, such as when using _reduce_ on either side:

{% highlight js %}
var arr = [1,2,3];

function sum( a, b ) {
  return a + b;
}

//standard pattern
arr.reduce( sum );    // 6
arr.reduce( sum, 4 ); // 10

//make _reduce and reduce_ global
_part_._augment( this )( Array.prototype.reduce, "reduce" );

//left-part pattern
_reduce( arr )( sum );     // 6
_reduce( arr, 4 )( sum );  // 10
_reduce( arr )( sum, 4 );  // 10

//right-part pattern
reduce_( sum )( arr );    // 6
reduce_( sum )( arr, 4 ); // 10
reduce_( sum, 4 )( arr ); // 10
{% endhighlight %}
