I sent my first *pull* request on [Github](https://github.com/), this week.

"Welcome to _two years ago_," you say.

Well, to be honest, I didn't really understand the *concept* behind Github.  A lot has changed in two years--I love my job.

I read [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani/)'s [article](http://addyosmani.com/blog/faster-javascript-memoization/)
on the *memoizer* and I clicked a link.  "Cool!"  He wrote it up in Github.  Wait, this code is different than the article.
Someone made improvements?!

That got me thinking.  I noticed a couple of things _I_ could make better, so I *forked* the
[master](https://github.com/addyosmani/memoize.js) and committed my changes.  Knowing that IE7 has no native JSON
support, I made the function fallback to just a no-op function.  Second, I realized that there was no need to
slice the arguments, you can stringify arguments and still get a unique cache key--a major performance boost.
Then I made a *pull* request to suggest that the changes get added back to the *master*.

To my surprise, and delight, [Jamie Mason](https://github.com/JamieMason) merged my ideas.
All-in-all, it was a rewarding experience and I can see myself doing it again.  Social coding... who knew?
I also see the value of writing code in Github then blogging it so the code conversation can continue after
the article--much easier to manage than comments in a blog.
