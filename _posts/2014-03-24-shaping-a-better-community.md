I read ["Dissent Unheard Of"](http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/dissent-unheard-of) by Ashe Dryden today.
My heart sank.  In the same week I read about [Julie Ann Horvath's exodus from GitHub](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/),
I feel like I lied to my daughter.

My daughter, a spunky, giddy, 11-year-old, inspires me.  When I changed careers, her kindergarten mind only knew
_"Daddy works on computers"_.  I always used computers for my job, but I never programmed them until relatively recently.
I try to answer her questions about what I do, and technology in general, or I encourage her to find her own answers.
To my surprise and delight, she loves [Scratch](scratch.mit.edu/), the MIT-created programming language for kids.
She creates imaginative programs with her virtual friends with little help, and no prodding, from me.

I recently told her, "Computer programming as a profession, unlike any other, is a meritocracy."  I explained, as I
often do, the etymology of the word, how it relates to other _-ocracies_, and how men and women, young and old often
work side by side; given equal treatment based on their skill and experience.  If she goes into tech today, she could
well call me out--a liar.

Not a day goes by I don't think teaching myself to
program was one of the best decisions I ever made.  And a lot of other white males agree--"life's great."  I love
groups like [@Code2040](http://code2040.org/) and [@Hackbright](http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/) but I worry about
the _segregation_ of diversity in tech.  How does that teach the __next__ generation of white, affluent, males the
tolerance and respect we want them to have?

I know I need to do more to protect my legacy and my progeny.  Could a group, striving to build a better community,
coach and mentor a highly diverse group rather than a homogeneous one?  When I return to the US, I want to answer that
question.
