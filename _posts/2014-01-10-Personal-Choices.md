We all make choices.  The fact that I'm living in Reykjavik right now, much closer than I've ever
knowingly been to an active volcano, clearly demonstrates how I would have answered the quiz above.

Before we moved here, I made the choice to reach out to JavaScripters from Iceland.  I found two teams
competing in [NodeKnockout](http://nodeknockout.com/) from Reykjavik.  One of the teams had a rich
profile that linked me to a developer group which linked me to a company homepage which linked me to
an email address.  To my surprise, a reply game.

That choice was rewarded.  I was pointed to their [Facebook Node.js group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nodejsis),
which I joined, despite my vocal and often hostile treatment of Facebook's UI. When I moved here in December,
the same day I arrived, I made another choice--possibly even more outgoing than the first.  I walked 2 km to one
of the group's meetups.

Again, I was rewarded.  Good pizza, lousy beer, and an excited, knowledgeable, and timely community of programmers.
I will probably present something to the group before I leave and I hope to make contacts that will facilitate idea-sharing
across borders when I go home.

Afterall, we have something in common: we code near an active volcano.
