A friend and I participated in [staticshowdown](http://www.staticshowdown.com/), a code-a-thon
for "static" applications.  While we won't win a prize for our app (we didn't really finish), I was awarded
a [No-Prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-Prize) from [Marvel Comics](http://marvel.com/) for finding a bug in
[their API](https://developer.marvel.com/) implementation.
